**Tech:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn), MySQL, SQLAlchemy

**Summary:**  
This project analyzes retail order data (sourced from Kaggle) to uncover sales trends, profitability insights, and top-performing products.  
It demonstrates **end-to-end workflow**: Data Cleaning ‚Üí SQL Storage ‚Üí Analysis Queries.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
- `data/` ‚Äî sample data in csv file 
- `python Script/` ‚Äî exploratory analysis (Jupyter)
- `sql/` ‚Äî DDL and analysis queries


## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed
1. Downloaded dataset from Kaggle (`ankitbansal06/retail-orders`).
2. Cleaned data using **Pandas**:
   - Handled null values, renamed columns, created derived columns (discount, sale_price, profit).
   - Dropped unnecessary columns.
3. Loaded cleaned data into **MySQL** using SQLAlchemy.
4. Wrote **SQL queries** for:
   - Top 10 revenue generating products.
   - Top 5 products per region.
   - Month-over-month sales growth (2022 vs 2023).
   - Highest sales month by category.
   - Sub-category with highest profit growth.

## üìä Insights Generated

- Regional analysis showed product preferences differ by region.
- Profit growth analysis revealed most profitable sub-categories.
- Sales comparison highlighted trends across 2022 vs 2023.

  -- find top 10 highest reveue generating products 
SELECT product_id,sum(sale_price) AS sales
